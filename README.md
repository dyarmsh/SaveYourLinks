# Save Your Links!
A chrome extension to save links so you never forget them
Programmed using HTML, CSS and JS

## How does this work?
You can input custom links OR even save the URLs of the current tab you are in. The links persist in the extension even if you exit!
You can delete all the links by double clicking on 'delete all'.

*Scrimba helped me code this up and I added my own tweaks to the UI/UX!*
